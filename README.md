# Bitcoin-price-prediction-Using-LSTM-2021
This is a project to build a model which predict price of bitcoin...
=> here we are using 4 libraries 

-> first we use libraries
/n1.numpy
/n2.matplotlib
/n3.padas
/n4.sklearn
/n5.tensorflow

=> source of this data is from finance.yahoo.com
=> then we imported libraries and all the data(.csv file)

->then we train our data
->build LSTM
->Tested Dataset

=>Got result and graph
