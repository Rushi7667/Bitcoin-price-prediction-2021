# Bitcoin-price-prediction-Using-LSTM-2021
This is a project to build a model which predict price of bitcoin...
=> here we are using 4 libraries 

-> first we use libraries
&nbsp;&1.numpy
&nbsp;&2.matplotlib
&nbsp;&3.padas
&nbsp;&4.sklearn
&nbsp;&5.tensorflow

=> source of this data is from finance.yahoo.com
=> then we imported libraries and all the data(.csv file)

->then we train our data
->build LSTM
->Tested Dataset

=>Got result and graph
